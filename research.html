        One of the most prominent and promising upcoming methods of sustainable transport are the electrical vertical
        takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles. eVTOL's aim is to completely remove the issue of traffic and fly at a
        conveniently fast speed, while remaining affordable enough for the average person. eVTOL's, while seeming
        futuristic and far-fetched, have had many advancements recently. On the 11th of March 2025, an eVTOL company
        named AVIC tested two new aircraft. Sources say it will have completed its maiden flight by the end of 2025.
        eVTOLs use high-density solid-state batteries to contain large amounts of energy in a small and light area.
        These new batteries charge fast, weigh less, last longer, and are much safer.

        In the public transport sector, new technology for hydrogen-powered trains has been explored. New PEM
        (proton-exchange membrane) fuel cells have been developed for the trains. These fuel cells are able to contain
        much denser amounts of hydrogen in the same space, making the hydrogen route much more viable. One of the major
        drawbacks to hydrogen fuel is its tendency to explode and catch fire, causing much devastation. This new type of
        fuel cell drastically improves the safety of the cell while improving efficiency.
