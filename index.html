    <p class="main">The task is to conceptualize, design and build a propeller powered small scale dragster using sustainable and recycled materials. The dragster must use a propeller (no more than 200mm in diameter) that is made from aluminium drink cans. It will be powered by a 3V electric motor. The car's chassis and structure will be made from sustainable and recycled materials. The goal is to make the car move 3 meters in at least 5 seconds.<br><br><a href="design.html" style="color: white !important;">Click here to view the design</a><br></p>
